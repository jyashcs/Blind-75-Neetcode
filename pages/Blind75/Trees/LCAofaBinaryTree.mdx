## Lowest Common Ancestor in Binary Search Tree ðŸŽ¯
###### Medium ðŸ¤¨

#### Problem statement

Given a binary search tree (BST) where all node values are unique, and two nodes from the tree p and q, return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the two nodes.
The lowest common ancestor between two nodes p and q is the lowest node in a tree T such that both p and q as descendants. The ancestor is allowed to be a descendant of itself.


#### Examples
```
Example 1:
Input: root = [5,3,8,1,4,7,9,null,2], p = 3, q = 8
Output: 5
Example 2:
Input: root = [5,3,8,1,4,7,9,null,2], p = 3, q = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 3 and 4 is 3, since a node can be a descendant of itself.
```
#### Constraints
```
2 <= The number of nodes in the tree <= 100.
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
p != q
p and q will both exist in the BST.
```

#### Recommended Time & Space Complexity
```
You should aim for a solution as good or better than O(h) time and O(h) space, where h is the height of the given tree.
```

#### Solution
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        while(root){
            if(root->val > p->val && root->val > q->val)
            root = root->left;
            else if(root->val < p->val && root->val < q->val)
            root = root->right;
            else 
            return root;
        }
        return root;
    }
};
```
