## Find Target in Rotated Sorted Array ðŸŽ¯

###### Medium ðŸ¤¨

#### Problem statement
You are given an array of length n which was originally sorted in ascending order. It has now been rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6] might become:

[3,4,5,6,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[1,2,3,4,5,6] if it was rotated 6 times.
Given the rotated sorted array nums and an integer target, return the index of target within nums, or -1 if it is not present.

You may assume all elements in the sorted rotated array nums are unique,

A solution that runs in O(n) time is trivial, can you write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time?
#### Examples
```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,6,1,2], target = 1
Output: 4
```
```
Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,5,6,0,1,2], target = 4
Output: -1
```
#### Constraints:
```
1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
-1000 <= target <= 1000
```

#### Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int st = 0 , end = nums.size()-1;

        while(st<=end){
            int mid = st+(end-st)/2;
            if(nums[mid] == target) return mid;
            if(nums[st] <= nums[mid]){
                if(nums[st] <= target && target <= nums[mid])
                end = mid - 1;
                else st = mid+1;
            }else{
                if(nums[mid] <= target && target <= nums[end])
                st = mid+1;
                else end = mid-1;
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
};
```
